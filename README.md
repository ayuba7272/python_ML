# python_ML
Creating this repository while I'm learning Python and Machine Learning. I have created a few of these Python Notebooks while learning these concepts myself and these should help anybody starting off to understand these ML techniques. I am planning to implement at least one real life case study to showcase the usage of each of these techniques.

About me: I am a ML enthusiast with over 4 years of experience in data sciences, visualization and process automation. I am proficient at analysis in SQL, SAS, Python, Excel and GIS. I have also worked extensively on visualizations in Excel, VBA, QlikView and Power BI. 
I have on several occasions worked on breaking down complex business problems and building agile analytical solutions using machine learning techniques such as regression, clustering, dcision trees, random forest classifiers and anomaly detection. Over the course of my career I have developed a good understanding of different business areas such as retail marketing and customer analytics, online web analytics, pharmaceutical contracting, sales territory planning, credit risk analysis and process automation.
